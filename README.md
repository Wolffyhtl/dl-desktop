## Manual Installation

 - Download the specific file that best fits your OS:
   - **apk**: Installation package for Alpine Linux.
   - **deb**: Installation package for Debian and Ubuntu, and of course all their derivates.
   - **snap**: Snap package installer, for distributions like e.g. Ubuntu.
   - **zip**: A simple zip archive containing a generic Linux or Windows build for all distros that can run without installation.
   - **AppImage**: A single big binary file holding the entire app that can run without installation.

## Using a package manager

On Arch Linux, the package is available on the AUR ([duolingo-desktop-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/duolingo-desktop-git/)).

For other distributions, you will have to check if someone included this package into the package manager's repository.

# Usage

If you've installed it through your package manager, then it should already contain a launcher for it. Otherwise, run the `duolingo-desktop` binary.
